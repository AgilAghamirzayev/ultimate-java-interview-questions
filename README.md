## OOP

### Question: What are the 4 pillars of OOPS?

Answer:

![oop.png](images/oop.png)

There are 4 pillars of OOPS are:

1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

Let‚Äôs take a look at them:

1. Abstraction is a way of hiding the implementation details of something and showing only the functionality that the
   user needs to know.
   This makes your code more organized and easy to understand because you can work with high-level ideas rather than
   getting lost in the complexities of every detail.

Real world examples:

- Car engine: When you drive a car, you don't need to know how the engine works or how the brakes work. You just need to
  know how to steer the car and how to use the pedals. The car abstracts away all of the complex internal details so
  that you can focus on driving.

- Computer: When you use a computer, you don't need to know how the hardware works or how the operating system works.
  You just need to know how to use the mouse and keyboard and how to open programs and files. The computer abstracts
  away all of the complex internal details so that you can focus on using the computer to do your work.

In java, Abstraction can be achieved in two ways:

- Abstract classes
- Interfaces

## AOP

### What is AOP?

Answer:
- Programming technique based on concept of an Aspect
- Aspect encapsulates cross-cutting logic
- Cross-cutting concerns (concern - logic/functionality)

![img.png](images/cross-cutting-concern.png)

### Which design pattern apply spring AOP?
Answer: Proxy design pattern

### What are the benefices of AOP?
Answer:

-
-
-

### AOP use cases
Answer:



### Advantages and Disadvantages of AOP
Answer:

- Advantages:
  - Reusable modules
  - Resolve code tangling
  - Resolve code scatter
  - Applied selectively based on configuration
- Disadvantages:
  - Too many aspects and app flow is hard to follow
  - Monitor performance cost for aspect execution (runtime weaving)

### AOP terminology
Answer:

- Aspect: module of code for a cross-cutting concern
- Advice: What action is taken and when is should be applied
- Join Point: When to apply code during program execution
- Point cut: A predicate expression for where advice should be applied


### What advice types are in AOP?
Answer:

- Before advice: run before the method
- After finally advice: run after the method (finally)
- After returning advice: run after the method (success execution)
- After throwing advice: run after the method (if exception thrown)
- Around advice: run before and after the method

### What type of weaving do you know?
Answer:

- Compile time 
- Load time (runtime)
- _Note: Runtime weaving is the slowest_


### What are the differences of Spring AOP and AspectJ




### AOP pointcut execution

## How can you find slow queries in PostgreSQL?
Answer:

- Using the slow query log: The slow query log is a file that logs all queries that take longer than a certain amount of time to execute.
- Using auto_explain extension: PostgreSQL can help to surface the slow queries, Lets explore in subsequent sections.
- Using pg_stat_statements: pg_stat_statements is a built-in PostgreSQL extension that collects statistics about SQL statements. This information can be used to identify the queries that are consuming the most CPU or I/O, and the ones that are causing the most waits.

### Question: What is the difference between Container vs virtual machine

Answer:

![container-virtual-machine.png](images/container-virtual-machine.png)

| Feature                     | Container                                                                               | Virtual machine                       |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Resource usage              | More efficient                                                                          | Less efficient                        |
| Start-up and shut-down time | Faster                                                                                  | Slower                                |
| Isolation                   | Shares the operating system kernel, but has its own isolated file system and resources	 | Has its own isolated operating system |
| Security                    | Less secure than VMs	                                                                   | More secure than containers           |

- Containers:
    - Share the host OS kernel, making them lightweight and efficient.
    - Minimal overhead, faster to start, and use fewer resources.
    - Provide process-level isolation; applications share the host kernel.
    - Highly portable across different environments.
    - Ideal for microservices, cloud-native apps, and quick scaling.

- Virtual Machines:
    - Run with their own OS and kernel, which can be resource-intensive.
    - Have more overhead, requiring additional memory and CPU resources.
    - Offer strong isolation due to separate OS instances.
    - Less portable, especially when migrating between hypervisors or providers.
    - Suited for legacy apps, strong isolation, and running different OS on one host.
