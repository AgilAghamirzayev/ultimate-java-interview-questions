## AOP

### What is AOP?

Answer:
- Programming technique based on the concept of an Aspect
- Aspect encapsulates cross-cutting logic
- Cross-cutting concerns (concern - logic/functionality)

### Which design pattern applies to spring AOP?
Answer: Proxy design pattern

### What are the benefices of AOP?
Answer:

-
-
-

### AOP use cases
Answer:



### Advantages and Disadvantages of AOP
Answer:

- Advantages:
  - Reusable modules
  - Resolve code tangling
  - Resolve code scatter
  - Applied selectively based on configuration
- Disadvantages:
  - Too many aspects and app flow is hard to follow
  - Monitor performance cost for aspect execution (runtime weaving)

### AOP terminology
Answer:

- Aspect: module of code for a cross-cutting concern
- Advice: What action is taken and when is should be applied
- Join Point: When to apply code during program execution
- Point cut: A predicate expression for where advice should be applied


### What advice types are in AOP?
Answer:

- Before advice: run before the method
- After finally advice: run after the method (finally)
- After returning advice: run after the method (success execution)
- After throwing advice: run after the method (if exception thrown)
- Around advice: run before and after the method

### What type of weaving do you know?
Answer:

- Compile time 
- Load time (runtime)
- _Note: Runtime weaving is the slowest_


### What are the differences of Spring AOP and AspectJ?




### AOP pointcut execution

## How can you find slow queries in PostgreSQL?
Answer:

- Using the slow query log: The slow query log is a file that logs all queries that take longer than a certain amount of time to execute.
- Using auto_explain extension: PostgreSQL can help to surface the slow queries, Lets explore in subsequent sections.
- Using pg_stat_statements: pg_stat_statements is a built-in PostgreSQL extension that collects statistics about SQL statements. This information can be used to identify the queries that are consuming the most CPU or I/O, and the ones that are causing the most waits.

### Question: What is the difference between Container vs virtual machine

Answer:

![container-virtual-machine.png](images/container-virtual-machine.png)

| Feature                     | Container                                                                               | Virtual machine                       |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Resource usage              | More efficient                                                                          | Less efficient                        |
| Start-up and shut-down time | Faster                                                                                  | Slower                                |
| Isolation                   | Shares the operating system kernel, but has its own isolated file system and resources	 | Has its own isolated operating system |
| Security                    | Less secure than VMs	                                                                   | More secure than containers           |

- Containers:
    - Share the host OS kernel, making them lightweight and efficient.
    - Minimal overhead, faster to start, and use fewer resources.
    - Provide process-level isolation; applications share the host kernel.
    - Highly portable across different environments.
    - Ideal for microservices, cloud-native apps, and quick scaling.

- Virtual Machines:
    - Run with their own OS and kernel, which can be resource-intensive.
    - Have more overhead, requiring additional memory and CPU resources.
    - Offer strong isolation due to separate OS instances.
    - Less portable, especially when migrating between hypervisors or providers.
    - Suited for legacy apps, strong isolation, and running different OS on one host.
